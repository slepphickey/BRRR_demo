# Fun w/R: `BRRR` Demo
![](images/fortune.png)
##### This demo will show you how to use Brook Watson Madubuonwu's [`BRRR`](https://github.com/brooke-watson/BRRR) package which let's a rapper tell you when your code is done running, like Lil John yelling "Yeah!"
![Let Lil John help you celebrate your code running succfully](images/lil_john.png)
##### It's inspired by Rasmus Bååth's [`beepr`](https://github.com/rasmusab/beepr) package which lets you use more conventional noises like themes from video games. I'll cover `beepr` a bit at the end.
